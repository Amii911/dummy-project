<p>we on our fucking bully! show activity for this month! 
    so this is going to be an offical diary entry!
    Today is actually the 11/16/23.
    I was banking on seeing Dr. Daniel Oana. He's a Romanian Ped Doctor. 
    Showed me his dog Winston (named after Winston Churchill) His grandson has a dog - dont remember that dog name
    He shared he enjoys history. 
    Hes was just such a gentle man!
    I need to fucking learn how to be more cooperative. He shared that he likes Thanksgiving and I immediatly shared that I do not like Thanksgiving becuse that is not a holiday my family and I go hard on. We go hard for thanksgiving. 
    He was just a pleasnt person to be around. He was polite, full of wisdom, and was just interesting. 
    He told he was going to call me, I think he did actually call me.
